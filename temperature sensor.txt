We aimed at creating a circuit with an Arduino card which would enable us to display the external temperature on our computer thanks to the help of a temperature sensor.
Thus, we used an arduino card, a temperature sensor, a resistance and the arduino software.

We encoded the arduino card in order to have the temperature adapted to an interesting scale and in Celsius degrees as it can be seen in the attached code.
